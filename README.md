### Manual
More detailed information is to follow.


## Citation

We also advise mentioning the software versions you used,
in particular the versions of the `mpiquiz`, and `psychTestR` packages.
You can find these version numbers from R by running the following commands:

``` r
library(psychTestR)
library(mpiquiz)
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
x <- devtools::session_info()
x$packages[x$packages$package %in% c("mpiquiz", "psychTestR"), ]
```

## Installation instructions (local use)

1. If you don't have R installed, install it from here: https://cloud.r-project.org/

2. Open R.

3. Install the ‘devtools’ package with the following command:

`install.packages('devtools')`

4. Install mpiquiz:

`devtools::install_github('klausfrieler/mpiquiz')`

## Usage

### Testing a participant

The `XYZ_standalone()` functions are  designed for real data collection.
In particular, the participant doesn't receive feedback during this version.

``` r
# Load the mpiquiz package
library(mpiquiz)

# Run the test as if for a participant, using default settings,
# saving data, and with a custom admin password
XYZ_standalone(admin_password = "put-your-password-here")
```
Replace 'XYZ' with one of the following three-letter acronyms:
* SRS (Speech Rhythm Sensitivity Test)

You will need to enter a participant ID for each participant which  will be stored along with the participants' results.

Each time you test a new participant, rerun the `XYZ_standalone()` function,
and a new participation session will begin.

You can retrieve your data by starting up a participation session,
entering the admin panel using your admin password, and downloading your data.
For more details on the psychTestR interface, see http://psychtestr.com/.

`mpiquiz` currently supports English (EN) and German (DE).
You can select one of these languages by passing a language code as 
an argument to `XYZ_standalone()`, e.g. `XYZ_standalone(languages = "de")`,
or alternatively by passing it to the browser as a URL parameter, eg. http://127.0.0.1:4412/?language=DE (note that the `p_id` argument must be empty).

## Installation instructions (Shiny Server)

1. Complete the installation instructions for 'local use' described above.

2. If not already installed, install Open Source Shiny Server from

https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/

3. Navigate to the Shiny Server app directory.

`cd /srv/shiny-server`

4. Create a directory which will contain your new Shiny app:

`sudo mkdir mpiquiz`

5. Create a text file in this directory called `app.R` which specifies the R code to run the app.

- Open the `app.R` in a text editor.

`sudo nano mpiquiz/app.R`

Paste below code into it replacing 'XYZ' with the three-letter acronym of the corresponding questionnaire.

``` r
library(mpiquiz)
XYZ_standalone(admin_password = "put-your-password-here")
```

- Save the file (CTRL-O).

6. Change the permissions of your app directory to allow `mpiquiz`
to write its temporary files.

`sudo chown -R shiny mpiquiz`

where `shiny` is the username for the Shiny process user
(this is the usual default).

7. Navigate to your new shiny app, with a URL similar to
http://my-web-page.org:3838/mpiquiz

## Usage notes

- The mpiquiz participation sessions run in your web browser.
